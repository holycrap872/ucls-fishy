# Fishy

This code is a partially completed version of the game [fishy](https://freefishy.org/).
Your mission is to create a fully working version that:

1. Gives the user fish the ability to move up/down/left/right
2. Has the "dinner fish" moving from right -> left or left -> right
3. Has the "dinner fish" properly reset whenever they reach the opposite wall
4. Has the user fish grow whenever it eats a "dinner fish" that is smaller than it
5. Has the user fish die whenever it runs into a "dinner fish" that is bigger than it
6. Has a "score" variable that shows how many fish the user has eaten
7. Resets the game when the user runs out of lives

To create fishy, you must do two things:
1. Follow [these instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rIdk_vk-tgh7_RPmZKn8qJc9L8iSBRDWfoNWK-HW5TA)
   for installing `vscode`
2. Follow [this worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gsYWeewpQPB9gjoGOE963jIxD110brmhtM3Qjbk9Ao8)
   for modifying `main.py` to create fishy
